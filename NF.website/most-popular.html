      <h1>How does the Christian world see famous NF?</h1>
      <p>
        NF is quite often called a Christian rapper as in his songs he often 
        talks about his faith and God, but most of NF’s songs are not overtly 
        Christian. The album Therapy Session makes it clear that NF writes music 
        with the aim of healing himself. Every track is like listening to him spill 
        his innermost thoughts, like reading someone’s private diary. In “Oh Lord,” NF raps:

        “I appreciate that he’s an artist that talks about real things and 
        makes good music too,” 20-year-old Keith Zimmerman said. He discovered 
        NF’s music in 2014, when the rapper only had an EP on the market. “He 
        never really portrayed himself as an artist like Lecrae or Andy Mineo,” 
        Zimmerman said. “He started out cussing, but then he saw it was unnecessary 
        for a Christian. It’s important to him that he makes music for everyone and 
        not just specifically for followers of Jesus Christ.”

        NF’s music is trademarked by his candid expression of rage, frustration, 
        and disappointment. His mother’s death by drug overdose in 2009 and his 
        fans’ stories of abuse, self-harm, and mental illness influence his lyrics. 
        One word to describe his music is heavy. Some critics wonder if the darkness 
        that seems to drive his music is healthy for him or his concertgoers.
