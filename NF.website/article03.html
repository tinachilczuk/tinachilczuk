        <h1>Album "Search"</h1>
        <p>The production of The Search succeeds in underscoring NF’s emotions. The dark, wistful piano keys and hard-knock drums consistently serve, but seldom overshadow, NF’s honesty and vulnerability. The beats retain a consistent tone throughout, and though there are only a few showstoppers – the haunting “Trauma” among them The only heavy knock on this project is its length. While NF’s conviction should never be in question, the album loses some of its luster as it wears on. For instance, the contemplative “Thinking” would have been much more impactful had it been placed earlier in the album, instead of at track No. 18 of 19. The project’s duration is surely welcome to Nate’s core fanbase, but a tighter listening experience would have made the album “The Search: more gripping and powerful.Nathan’s journey finds him heaving things off his chest and slamming them onto tracks, leaving no stone unturned in his self-examination. This creates for intimate portrayals of a self-aware man, such as on the message to his younger self, “Nate.” The cut bleeds with regret and rumination as NF forewarns his mini about the dangers that lay ahead. Elsewhere, he laments self-disgust on “Hate Myself,” an eye-opening track that pushes the bounds of what rappers who are Christians can rap about. Songs like these have the power to stop listeners in their tracks and push the album “The Search” beyond the every bounds of a therapy session. NF’s songs are known to heal.</p>
          <p>“Even if we both breakdown tonight. And you said you hate me and we go to bed angry. I know everything will be alright. I will be here waiting, I promise I’m changing. I just need time.”</p>
