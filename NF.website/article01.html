        <h1>What's his music like?</h1>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>Obviously, Feuerstein worships the godfather of white rap, fellow son of Michigan and his doppelgänger: Eminem. To some extent, like his idol, he makes aggressive, intensely personal songs about his traumatic upbringing, which included being abused by his mother’s boyfriend and his mother’s overdose. He shares Eminem’s spitty, machine gun flow, but his music listens like a radio-friendly version of the embattled rapper. His lyrics are moody and literal; cinematic string and piano chord interludes abound; and often his rhymes are heard soft pop-rap production — though not always. But he’s more angsty than angry, and his discontent is PG-13. His songs are wrought sagas about self-doubt, heartbreak, betrayal, industry struggles, the ills of our culture and the obstacles he’s faced in his life, that match up with the soft nihilism of his tough-boy emo aesthetic. He’s pretty much only photographed in dark t-shirts, jeans and hoodies (a la a certain era of Eminem, but with Hot Topic pre-ripped skinny jeans). His new album cover shows him pushing a grocery cart in a field, solemnly holding a bouquet of black balloons like a 2009 Tumblr post plus Timberlands. He often performs with a Joker homage extended smile, drawn on his face with black marker, apparently, to represent the superficial positivity or “fake smile” our society demands of hurting people, like NF himself. NF is always called “The Joker”. It is wrong to call him a “Christian rapper.” His lyrics rarely include boilerplate Christian pop language about worship and devotion, like Daughtry or Creed. However, even as he’s started rapping less about religion over his career, there are still parameters of Christian respectability and an ethic of atonement and uplift to his music. Even while he’s rapping about suicidal feelings or how messed up his life and the world are, NF never talks about violence. He doesn’t rap about sex, and takes pride in how he “respects” or at least doesn’t brag about conquests with women. The cleanliness makes it feel like, even in his rage and melancholy, at any moment, he could drop a bar about his king getting him through toughest time in his life.</p>
