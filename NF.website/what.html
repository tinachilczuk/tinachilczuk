      <h1>What's his music like?</h1>

  <p>Obviously, Feuerstein worships the godfather of white rap, 
    fellow son of Michigan and his doppelgänger: Eminem. To some extent, 
    like his idol, he makes aggressive, intensely personal songs about his 
    traumatic upbringing, which included being abused by his mother’s boyfriend 
    and his mother’s overdose. He shares Eminem’s spitty, machine gun flow, but 
    his music listens like a radio-friendly version of the embattled rapper. His 
    lyrics are moody and literal; cinematic string and piano chord interludes abound;
     and often his rhymes are heard soft pop-rap production — though not always.</p>
